I initially started this github during an indivudial study Machine Learning in Image Analysis with Dr. Dimitri Volchenkov 
in Texas Tech University. After that I have decided to redesign it with several applications of deep neural 
networks with the underlying mathematical ideas behind it. I am planning to post more applications concerning neural networks 
by first briefly explaining the mathematical foundations of that application and then 
implementing some of the technique introduced in the theory using Pytorch. I am glad to hear your feedback (and more 
importantly criticism) on the posts!
