I initially started this github during an Machine Learning indivudial study with Dr. Dimitri Volchenkov 
in Mathematics and Statistics in Texas Tech University. After that I have decided to redesign it with several applications of deep neural networks with the underlying mathematical ideas behind it. I am planning to post more applications concerning neural networks by first briefly explaining the mathematical foundations and then implementing some of the technique introduced in the theory using Pytorch. I am glad to hear your feedback.
